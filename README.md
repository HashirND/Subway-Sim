Train Simulation & Real-Time Data Integration System

This project is a Java-based train simulation system that integrates live weather and news data through RESTful APIs and provides a dynamic user experience with real-time updates and announcements.

**Features:**

-Train Simulation: Implements a train system with multiple lines and stations, using object-oriented principles for train initialization, movement, and station announcements.

-API Integration: Fetches live weather and news data via HTTP requests using HttpURLConnection, and dynamically parses JSON responses to display relevant information.

-Text-to-Speech Announcements: Utilizes the FreeTTS library to simulate real-time station announcements for trains.

-File Handling: Efficient CSV parsing for train stations and coordinates, along with CSV export of train positions, showcasing robust file I/O operations.

-Error Handling: Includes advanced exception management for API requests and file operations, ensuring stability and smooth performance.

**Key Technologies:**

-Java

-RESTful API (HttpURLConnection)

-JSON Parsing

-FreeTTS Library (Text-to-Speech)

-CSV Parsing and File I/O Operations
